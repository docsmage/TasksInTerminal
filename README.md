Welcome to TasksInTerminal! To run this file, please do the following:

1) Clone the git repository to your local machine. (For non-programmers, that means copy/pasting the 'clone' link on the repository page, then typing 'git clone' followed by the link into your terminal.)

2) Navigate to the correct set of files using your terminal. (Non-programmers: use 'cd', 'sls', and 'pwd' commands to do this. Review Zed Shaw's !(Command Line Crash Course)[http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/] to learn how to do this on your own.)

3) Once you are in the correct folder, type 'todo.rb' into your terminal to run the task list. Enjoy!
